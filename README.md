# Simple API: Joke GENERATOR
#### Project Scope: The user presses a button to get the joke "set up". Another button will appear which when pressed, will reveal the punch line and a random joke GIPHY. The program fetches the JSON response from Official Joke API and I've added buttons to simulate a more human "joke telling" situation.

# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON

# Optimizations:
#### Press the button and it will randomly give you a joke!

# Lesson Learned:
#### An easier way of organizing content placement without needing to manipulate much of the margin is by displaying the content with flexbox. Then you can justify or align items with values of "flex-end" "center" etc. to get it to sit exactly where you want it.
